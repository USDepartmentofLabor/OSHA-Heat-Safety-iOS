        <h1>Very High To Extreme Risk</h1>
        
        <p>Conditions are dangerous! Heat illness can develop faster and be more serious at this risk level. Extra measures are recommended.</p>
        <p><em>Reschedule all non-essential work for days when the heat index is lower. Move essential work to the coolest part of the day – start earlier, split the work shift, or work evening/night shifts.</em></p>
        <p>If emergency or essential work must be done at this heat index, then a designated knowledgeable person should be on-site to modify work activities and set work/rest schedules. <em>STOP WORK if protective measures are not possible.</em></p>
        <p>Important reminders (<a href="http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html">see OSHA’s heat illness campaign site</a> for more information and resources):</p>
        
        <h2>Water and Shade</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking water must be on site. Establish a water drinking schedule (about 4 cups/hour).</li>
            <li>Set up cool, shaded rest areas.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Call 911 and <a href="First Aid.html#heatstroke">cool a worker</a> who is unconscious, confused, or uncoordinated. This may be <a href="Signs and Symptoms.html#heatstroke">heat stroke</a>, which is a medical emergency.</li>
            <li>Know where you are in case you need to call 911.</li>

        <h2>Work and Rest</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gradually build up the workload and allow more breaks over a week (acclimatize workers).</li>
            <li>Establish and follow a work/rest schedule (amount of work time and rest time each work hour)
                <ul>
                    <li>Take routine rest breaks in cool, shaded area</li>
                    <li>Remove protective clothing (if possible) while resting</li>
                    <li>Increase rest time as heat index rises or if workers show signs of heat illness</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Adjust work activities
                <ul>

                    <li>Decrease the pace of heavy job tasks</li>
                    <li>Add more workers to heavy job tasks</li>
                    <li>Rotate workers between heavy and lighter jobs</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Provide cooling measures (cool vests, cool mist stations)</li>
            <li>Use more precautions for work in layers of protective clothing and the direct sun - see <a href="http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/protective_veryhigh.html">OSHA's heat illness campaign site</a></li>
            <li>Use sunscreen and wear light-colored clothing.</li>

            <li>Watch out for each other.</li>
            <li>Set up a buddy system.</li>
            <li>Supervisors should maintain communications at all times with crew and watch for signs of heat illness.</li>
