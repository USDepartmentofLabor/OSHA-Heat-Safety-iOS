        <h1>Very High To Extreme Risk</h1>
        
        <p>Conditions are dangerous! Heat illness can develop faster and be more serious at this risk level. Extra measures are recommended.</p>
        <p><strong>Reschedule all non-essential work for days when the heat index is lower. Move essential work to the coolest part of the day – start earlier, split the work shift, or work evening/night shifts.</strong></p>
        <p>If emergency or essential work must be done at this heat index, then a designated knowledgeable person should be on-site to modify work activities and set work/rest schedules. <strong>STOP WORK if protective measures are not possible.</strong></p>
        <p>Important reminders (<a href="http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html">see OSHA’s heat illness campaign site</a> for more information and resources):</p>
        
        <h2>Water and Shade</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking water must be on site. Establish a water drinking schedule (about 4 cups/hour).</li>
            <li>Set up cool, shaded rest areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Emergency Planning and Response</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure medical help (clinic, hospital, emergency services) is nearby – if not, first aid must be on site.</li>
            <li>Call 911 and cool a worker who is unconscious, confused, or uncoordinated. This may be heat stroke, which is a medical emergency.</li>
            <li>Know where you are in case you need to call 911.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Work and Rest</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gradually build up the workload and allow more breaks over a week (acclimatize workers).</li>
            <li>Establish and follow a work/rest schedule (amount of work time and rest time each work hour)
                <ul>
                    <li>Take routine rest breaks in cool, shaded area</li>
                    <li>Remove protective clothing (if possible) while resting</li>
                    <li>Increase rest time as heat index rises or if workers show signs of heat illness</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Adjust work activities
                <ul>
                    <li>Do heavy tasks earlier in the day</li>
                    <li>Decrease the pace of heavy job tasks</li>
                    <li>Add more workers to heavy job tasks</li>
                    <li>Rotate workers between heavy and lighter jobs</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Provide cooling measures (cool vests, cool mist stations)</li>
            <li>Use more precautions for work in layers of protective clothing and the direct sun - see <a href="http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/protective_veryhigh.html">OSHA's heat illness campaign site</a></li>
            <li>Use sunscreen and wear light-colored clothing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Training</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Alert all workers of extreme heat hazard.</li>
            <li>Review heat-related illness topics before work begins
                <ul>
                    <li>How to recognize heat-related illness</li>
                    <li>How to prevent it</li>
                    <li>What to do if someone gets sick</li>

        <h2>Watching Out for Heat Illness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Check heart rate, temperature, or other physical signs of heat exposure at rest breaks.</li>
            <li>Watch out for each other.</li>
            <li>Set up a buddy system.</li>
            <li>Supervisors should maintain communications at all times with crew and watch for signs of heat illness.</li>
        </ul>
