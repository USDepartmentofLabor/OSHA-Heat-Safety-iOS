        <h1>High Risk</h1>
        
        <p>Conditions are hazardous. Extra measures are recommended. Alert everyone of high risk conditions and review protective measures. A designated knowledgeable person should be on site to modify work activities and set work/rest schedules.</p>
        <p>Reminders to help keep workers safe (<a href="http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html">see OSHA’s heat illness campaign site</a> for more information and resources):</p>
