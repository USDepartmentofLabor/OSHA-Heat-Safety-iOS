        <h1>High Risk</h1>
        
        <p>Conditions are hazardous. Extra measures are recommended. Alert everyone of high risk conditions and review protective measures. A designated knowledgeable person should be on site to modify work activities and set work/rest schedules.</p>
        <p>Reminders to help keep workers safe (<a href="http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html">see OSHA’s heat illness campaign site</a> for more information and resources):</p>
        
        <h2>Water and Shade:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking water must be on site.</li>
            <li>Drink plenty of water, even if you’re not thirsty – every 15 minutes (about 4 cups/hour).</li>
            <li>Set up cool, shaded rest areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Emergency Planning and Response</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure medical help (clinic, hospital, emergency services) is nearby – if not, first aid must be on site.</li>
            <li>Call 911 and cool a worker who is unconscious, confused, or uncoordinated. This may be heat stroke, which is a medical emergency.</li>
            <li>Know where you are in case you need to call 911.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Work and Rest</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gradually build up the workload and allow more breaks over a week (acclimatize workers).</li>
            <li>Establish and follow a work/rest schedule (amount of work time and rest time each work hour)
                <ul>
                    <li>Take routine rest breaks in cool, shaded area</li>
                    <li>Remove protective clothing (if possible) while resting</li>
                    <li>Increase rest time as heat index rises or if workers show signs of heat illness</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Adjust work activities
                <ul>
                    <li>Do heavy tasks earlier in the day</li>
                    <li>Decrease the pace of heavy job tasks</li>
                    <li>Look for other ways to adjust work activities (add more workers, rotate jobs)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use more precautions for work in layers of protective clothing and in the direct sun - see <a href="http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/protective_high.html">OSHA's heat illness campaign site</a></li>
            <li>Use sunscreen and wear light-colored clothing.</li>
