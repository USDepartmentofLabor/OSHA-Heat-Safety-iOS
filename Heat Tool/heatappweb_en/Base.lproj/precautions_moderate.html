        <h1>Moderate Risk</h1>

        <p>Workers can be at increased risk for heat illness. Important reminders:</p>
        
        <h2>Water and Shade</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking water must be on site.</li>
            <li>Drink plenty of water, even if you’re not thirsty – every 15 minutes (about 4 cups/hour).</li>
            <li>Set up cool, shaded rest areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Emergency Planning and Response</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure medical help (clinic, hospital, emergency services) is nearby – if not, first aid must be on site.</li>
            <li>Call 911 and cool a worker who is unconscious, confused, or uncoordinated. This may be heat stroke, which is a medical emergency.</li>
            <li>Know where you are in case you need to call 911.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="img5.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Gradually build up workload and allow more breaks over the first week for new or returning workers (acclimatize workers).</li>
            <li>Use more precautions for heavy work, layers of protective clothing, and work in the direct sun
                <ul>
                    <li>Schedule activities at a time when the heat index is lower</li>
                    <li>Develop and follow work/rest schedules (amount of work time and rest time each work hour)</li>
                    <li>Decrease the pace of heavy job tasks</li>
                    <li>Monitor workers closely for signs of heat illness</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use sunscreen and wear light-colored clothing.</li>
        </ul>
